You are working in a React Native Expo app using Expo Router and TypeScript.

Goal
Build Dayshaker, a mobile-only lifestyle app that shows one small daily "shake" and lets users mark done, skip, and favorite, with history and saved lists. No login in v1.

Hard rules
Do not overwrite or delete existing screens, routes, or content pages unless the user explicitly says to remove them.
Do not change navigation structure (Expo Router) without explaining the new routes.
Do not introduce React Navigation.
Do not add new libraries unless required. If needed, explain why and keep additions minimal.
Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions.
No long hyphens (—) in any user-facing strings or comments.

Architecture rules
Use Expo Router with app/ routes.
Put non-UI logic in src/logic.
Put local data and DB helpers in src/data.
Put theme in src/theme.
Put reusable UI components in src/ui.
Keep modules small and named by responsibility.

Daily shake rules
Daily shake must be deterministic per local day and per device, and must not change during the day.
Compute date key as local YYYY-MM-DD.
Seed should be deviceId + ":" + dateKey.
Persist the assigned shake for that date in local SQLite so it survives restarts and library updates.

Local persistence rules
Use expo-sqlite for persistence in v1.
Tables:
daily_assignments(date_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, shake_id TEXT NOT NULL, created_at TEXT NOT NULL)
user_actions(date_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, shake_id TEXT NOT NULL, status TEXT NOT NULL, saved INTEGER NOT NULL, updated_at TEXT NOT NULL)
Status must be one of: new, done, skipped.
Saved is 0 or 1.

UI rules
Default background: plum.
Text: light.
Accents: coral for the wordmark, gold wave, blue wave.
Keep UI minimal, fun, and adult-friendly.
Use safe area and reasonable spacing.
Do not use bold text unless explicitly asked.

Implementation rules
Use TypeScript everywhere.
Avoid any and as casts.
Add basic error handling, but keep logs quiet.
Write helper functions for DB reads and writes.
Keep functions pure where possible.
When making changes, prefer incremental edits, not broad rewrites.

What to output
When asked for code changes, propose the smallest set of files to modify, then implement them.
Always include the file path at the top of each code block.
